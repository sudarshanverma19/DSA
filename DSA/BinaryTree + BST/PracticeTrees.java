/*Certainly! Here are ten practice problems to help you improve your understanding of trees:

1. **Check if a Binary Tree is Balanced**
   - Write a function to determine if a binary tree is height-balanced. A binary tree is balanced if the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.

2. **Maximum Depth of Binary Tree**
   - Write a function to find the maximum depth (or height) of a binary tree.

3. **Symmetric Tree**
   - Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

4. **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of a Binary Tree**
   - Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor of two given nodes in the tree.

5. **Binary Tree Level Order Traversal**
   - Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

6. **Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree**
   - Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

7. **Binary Tree Inorder Traversal**
   - Implement an iterative and a recursive function to perform an in-order traversal of a binary tree.

8. **Path Sum**
   - Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

9. **Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree**
   - Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Serialization is the process of converting a tree to a string, and deserialization is the process of converting the string back to a tree.

10. **Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List**
    - Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place. The flattened tree should follow the same order as a pre-order traversal.

These problems will help you practice a variety of operations and algorithms involving trees, from basic traversals and checks to more complex transformations and manipulations. */
